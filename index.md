## About Me

I am currently interning at Google Research ([Health AI team](https://health.google/)). I am an IvyPlus Exchange Ph.D. Scholar at MIT [EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/)& [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/) and am pursuing my Ph.D. at Cornell University. My name means "happy walking is good", and the pronunciation is "You-Sing."

I hold Computer Science degrees from Rutgers University (B.A.) and Tufts University (M.S). My Ph.D. focuses mainly on AI-based Healthcare Technology, Human-AI interaction, and Healthcare Intelligence. Presently, I am based in the beautiful Mountain View, CA. In my spare time, I love to do many outdoor activities, such as ice hockey, squash, and water skiing.

My [old personal website](https://1135100136.wixsite.com/yuexinghao/blog) with some interesting posts. Stop using it from Aug 2022.
