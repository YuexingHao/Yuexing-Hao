Yuexing Hao Personal Page

## HaoChat (Qwen 14B on Hugging Face)

The **HaoChat** tab lets visitors ask questions about Yuexing; answers are generated by Qwen 14B via Hugging Face. Page and Space setup docs live in the **[HaoChat](HaoChat/)** folder.

**To enable HaoChat:**

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (so the `/api/chat` serverless function runs):
   - Connect this repo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
   - In the project, go to **Settings → Environment Variables** and add `HF_TOKEN` with your [Hugging Face access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) (needs “Inference API” or similar).
   - Redeploy. The chat page will call `/api/chat` on the same domain.

2. **If you use GitHub Pages only:** Deploy the `api/` folder as a separate Vercel project, then in `_config.yml` set:
   ```yaml
   haochat_api_url: https://your-api.vercel.app
   ```
   so the chat UI uses that URL for `/api/chat`.
