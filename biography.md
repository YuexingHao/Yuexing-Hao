  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Yuexing Hao is an IvyPlus Exchange Ph.D. Scholar at MIT (2024-25) and a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Cornell University (2021-25). She earns two Computer Science degrees from Rutgers University (B.A., 2017-20) and Tufts University (M.S, 2020-21). During her study, Yuexing won the 2024 North America Women in Tech Most Disruptive Award powered by Amazon, NCWIT AIC Collegiate Award (Honorable Mention), second prize in IEEE Communication Society Student Competition, ACM SIGCHI 2023 Gary Marsden Travel Award, Meritorious Prize in the 2020 Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM), and Graduate Student Research Competition Award at Tufts University. Yuexing also published several papers at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Intelligent System Conference, AAAI, and Bioinformatics. She reviewed top-venue conferences serving as registration co-chair for FAccT, associate chair for CSCW and CHI. Currently, her research focus is on Health Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, and AI.</p>

  <h2>Brief Research Overview</h2>
  <p>In today's healthcare system, patients often feel disconnected from clinical professionals and their care journey. They receive a "one-size-fits-all" plan and are left out of the decision-making process, which can lead to a less satisfying experience. My research focuses on applying advanced AI technologies, including large language models, machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, to address challenges in healthcare, particularly in patient-centered healthcare delivery. I aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of healthcare systems by using these "objective approaches" to navigate the "subjective" aspects of medical practice, such as clinician notes and patient preferences found in electronic health records. A key aspect of my work is improving the transparency of AI-based healthcare applications, making them more understandable and trustworthy for both clinicians and patients, by addressing critical issues such as building trust in AI systems and ensuring these technologies effectively meet the needs of patients and healthcare providers. Additionally, I emphasize the importance of personalizing healthcare by considering each patient's unique circumstances, including their preferences and socio-economic conditions. This research applies AI across various areas, from specific diseases like cancer to broader healthcare contexts, with the goal of improving both the delivery and experience of healthcare. My work contributes to the development of AI tools that not only enhance clinical decision-making but also foster better human-AI interaction, ultimately leading to improved healthcare outcomes.</p>

  <p>My Ph.D. research, titled "Objective Approaches in a Subjective Medical World," is structured around three pivotal stages. The first stage, Integration [laboratory], involves exploring advanced technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs), machine learning (ML) models, and Explainable AI (xAI) to enhance and support clinical decision-making. The second stage, Interaction [field], focuses on applying and embedding these technologies into real-world clinical settings. Finally, the Implementation [at scale/in the wild] stage assesses the impact of AI-based healthcare technologies on user experience and outcomes. Beginning with a specialized sample for the initial needs assessment, the research progresses to a field-sized interaction study, potentially leading to positive social impacts during the implementation stage with wider and more diverse populations.</p>
