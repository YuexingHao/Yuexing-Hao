Welcome to 13-day-old Dr. Hao's blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences in AI research, healthcare technology, and beyond. All my blogs are written without AI so bear with me on grammar errors. 

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about my random thoughts in **AI Research**; my prior experience working in the **Healthcare AI** domain in community, healthcare, and industry environments; and reflecting my **Academic Life**.

## My Research Journey

I started my Ph.D. from August 22nd, 2022, though I actually started my research assistant after graduating from Tufts University in December 2021. I graduated from my Ph.D. in 3.5 yrs, 1231 days.  

In my third year, I received IvyPlus Exchange Ph.D. scholarship and 

During my Ph.D., I mainly worked on applied science in AI and healthcare. My research focuses on:

1. **Human-AI Interaction**: Understanding how people interact with AI systems
2. **Clinical Decision Support**: Building tools that help healthcare professionals make better decisions
3. **LLM Reverse Engineering**: Exploring how large language models work and how to improve them

## Why Blog?

I love writing and talking. Maybe sometimes too talkative. I always felt: "woah, this piece of thing is so exciting and I can't wait to share with my friends." Then I forgot. 

So writing down my thoughts is the only solution. Maybe not the best, but it's a absolute good way to observe what I think at that time. 

## Stay Connected

I'll be posting regularly about my research, interesting papers I'm reading, conference experiences, and lessons learned along the way.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to discuss any of the topics I cover!
