## My Research Journey

As a Postdoctoral Researcher at MIT's Healthy ML Group, I work on cutting-edge problems in AI and healthcare. My research spans:

1. **Human-AI Interaction**: Understanding how people interact with AI systems
2. **Clinical Decision Support**: Building tools that help healthcare professionals make better decisions
3. **LLM Reverse Engineering**: Exploring how large language models work and how to improve them

## Why Blog?

I believe in:

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Making research accessible to broader audiences
- **Community Building**: Connecting with other researchers and practitioners
- **Reflection**: Writing helps crystallize thinking and identify new insights

## Stay Connected

I'll be posting regularly about my research, interesting papers I'm reading, conference experiences, and lessons learned along the way.
