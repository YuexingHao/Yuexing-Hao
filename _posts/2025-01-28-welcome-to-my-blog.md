Welcome to 13-day-old Dr. Hao's blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences in AI research, healthcare technology, and beyond. All my blogs are written without AI so bear with me on grammar errors. 

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about my random thoughts in **AI Research**; my prior experience working in the **Healthcare AI** domain in community, healthcare, and industry environments; and reflecting my **Academic Life**. 

Reflecting my Ph.D., I am very grateful for my committee member and my amazing family. They shape who I am.

## My Research Journey

I started my Ph.D. in Cornell University (yes, ithaca campus not the fancy NYC one) from August 22nd, 2022, though I actually started my research assistant after graduating from Tufts University in December 2021. I graduated from my Ph.D. in 3.5 yrs, 1231 days.  

In my third year (June 2024), I received IvyPlus Exchange Ph.D. scholarship and exchanged to MIT. This exchange supposed to be 3 months. Then it kept on extending to be 18 months. Looking back, I felt extremely fortunate.

During my Ph.D., I mainly worked on applied science in AI and healthcare. My research focuses on:

1. **Human-AI Interaction**: Understanding how patients and clinicians interact with AI systems
2. **Clinical Decision Support**: Building tools that help healthcare professionals make better decisions
3. **LLM Reverse Engineering**: Exploring + evaluating how large language models work and how to improve them through data attribution

My research would be impossible without my amazing academia siblings, friends, collaborators (proofs attached below).

I also went to many beautiful places within US, China, and globally: Costa Rica, Germany (twice!), Canada (twice!), Mexico, and Barbados. Most travels happened because of conferences. 

## Why Blog?

I love writing and talking. Maybe sometimes too talkative. I always felt: "woah, this piece of thing is so exciting and I can't wait to share with my friends." Then I forgot. 

Also, I love to share some background story about how some exciting research ideas, collaborations, career milestones are being made in the "backstage". It may be more interesting to read comparing to the research paper. That's the synthesis of successful results, but here I hope to record the blood, sweat, tear, failures, and rejections behind it.

## Stay Connected

I'll be posting regularly about my research, interesting papers I'm reading, conference experiences, and lessons learned along the way. Thanks for reading my ramblings. 

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to discuss any of the topics I cover!
