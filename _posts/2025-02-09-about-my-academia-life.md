I started my undergrad in the US in 2017. Initially in my college application, my mom suggested biomedical statistics as my major. After I started my first semester, I truly believed Computer Science was the future. The first Computer Science class was super fun, playing around with Scratch. I enjoyed the class and later on in my senior year I became a head TA and part-time lecturer. That's the starting point of my academic "career".

I still remember in my second year, I failed Calculus II (getting a D). If I retook it again and still got below C, then I would be out of the Computer Science major. That was summer 2019, extremely hot in New Jersey. I felt super anxious and was afraid of being forced to drop out of the major. Fortunately, in the following Fall semester, I passed.

At the end of my sophomore year, I had a friend randomly come to my dorm to have barbeque together. She asked about my plan, and I told her I only knew I wanted to graduate in 3 years and maybe apply for a PhD. She looked me in the eyes and said, "you have limited experience in conducting research and clearly you are not prepared for it. You need to find a research advisor and do research." That changed my life. I started to contact several professors and fortunately Prof. Mubbasir Kapadia (https://ivi.cs.rutgers.edu/) accepted me as an undergrad research assistant. From then on, I officially started my research career and submitted to multiple places such as AAAI undergrad consortium (rejected), Rutgers Aresty Research Center (got $1000), and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM) (meritorious winner).

Then, I started my master's during Covid. I think online classes are great. I tried my best to do research and write a paper, but I didn't know how to start. I wasn't sure about my research interests and career plan. Many times, I felt hopeless. I also applied to several big tech companies to do internships but none of them succeeded.

Reflecting back, my undergrad and master's time were not really good. Comparing to many people who started their research and published a lot, I "wasted" my time. I spent most of the time learning and studying. But I think starting research early is not really helpful, as the whole mindset becomes about publishing. But that's not the whole point of research. Research is about exploring curiosity, doing something fun and impactful, and finding novel solutions. It's supposed to fail a lot. Research means wasting time on replicating other people's failures, reading other people's fancy papers, and even deep-thinking. (I am not defending why I am not productive; I am defending that when I am not writing papers and looking productive, I am still doing research)

After starting my Ph.D., my life became different. I started to know how to write an HCI paper and learned more about the publishing mechanisms. Just judging from the research question, I could tell how good a project would turn out. I also started to know what kind of mentorship I needed. Before my Ph.D., I didn't even know what kind of assistance I needed to write a paper.

I am super fortunate that I got a lot of support during my Ph.D. There were many things that I didn't receive support for and later on looking back, I felt extremely grateful that I failed. But I tried 120% before I admitted I failed. At that time I felt I was a loser.

Rejections are hard to navigate, especially in the beginning. I usually feel dealing with rejections needs a kind of mindset: no matter if it's success or failure, in the end, it's hallucination. You are still who you are. Be persistent and eventually you will get to where you want.

C. P. CAVAFY wrote a poem called "Ithaka" and there is one favorite line:

<div style="text-align: center">

> "Hope your road is a long one... Keep Ithaka always in your mind.
Arriving there is what you’re destined for.
But don’t hurry the journey at all.
> Better if it lasts for years,
so you’re old by the time you reach the island,
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,
> not expecting Ithaka to make you rich."
